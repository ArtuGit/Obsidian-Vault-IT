### 🔐 **What is a Session?**

A **session** is a way to store data about a user **between HTTP requests**, since HTTP is stateless by default. Sessions are commonly used for **user authentication**, **shopping carts**, and **temporary storage** of user-specific data.

## 🧠 **Backend (BE) – Server-Side Sessions**

In the backend, a **session** usually means storing **user-specific data on the server**, and tracking it using a **unique session ID**.

### 🔄 How It Works:

1. ✅ **User logs in** → Server creates a session and stores data (e.g., user ID).
    
2. 📦 **Server sends back a session ID** to the client via a `Set-Cookie` header:
```http
Set-Cookie: session_id=abc123; HttpOnly; Path=/
```
🔁 On future requests, the browser automatically includes:
```http
Cookie: session_id=abc123
```
🗂️ Server uses the `session_id` to retrieve the user’s data from memory, a database, or a store like **Redis**.   

### 🛠️ Tools used:

- Express-session (Node.js)
    
- Redis / MemoryStore for scalable session storage
    
- CSRF protection with sessions

## 🖥️ **Frontend (FE) – Client-Side Sessions**

On the frontend, the session is not the data itself, but the **handling of the session token or cookie** provided by the server.

### FE Responsibilities:

- ✅ Automatically sending session cookies with each request.
    
- ❌ Should **not store sensitive session data** in localStorage or JS-accessible cookies.
    
- 📡 Sometimes sends tokens (e.g. JWTs) manually in headers.
    

### Example:
```JS
// In browser
document.cookie = "session_id=abc123"; // not recommended for HttpOnly
```
Modern frontend apps (e.g., React/Vue) often use **session-aware APIs** — but they don’t manage sessions directly, just store the token or send authenticated requests.

### 🔍 Session vs Token (JWT):

| Feature      | Session-Based Auth                         | Token-Based Auth (JWT)              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Data Storage | Server-side                                | Client-side (in token)              |
| Scalability  | Needs sticky sessions / shared store       | Stateless, easier to scale          |
| Security     | Secure, especially with `HttpOnly` cookies | Needs care with storage (e.g., XSS) |
