The **Gartner 7Rs** is a framework created by Gartner to guide organizations in making decisions about **application modernization** and **cloud migration** strategies. It categorizes different approaches for transforming or moving applications, especially when transitioning to the cloud.

Here are the **7 Rs** in the Gartner framework:

1. **Rehost** ("Lift and Shift")
    
    - **What it is:** Moving an application to a new infrastructure (often the cloud) without changing its architecture or code.
        
    - **Use case:** Quick migration, minimal cost and time investment.
        
2. **Refactor** ("Repackage")
    
    - **What it is:** Modifying the application to better support the cloud environment without changing its core architecture.
        
    - **Use case:** When you need to optimize for cloud capabilities like auto-scaling, but can't rewrite the whole app.
        
3. **Rearchitect**
    
    - **What it is:** Changing the application's architecture significantly to fully leverage cloud-native features.
        
    - **Use case:** Legacy apps that need modernization for scalability, agility, and performance.
        
4. **Rebuild**
    
    - **What it is:** Completely rewriting the application from scratch using modern tools, languages, and cloud-native frameworks.
        
    - **Use case:** When the current application can’t meet business needs and starting over is more beneficial than modifying.
        
5. **Replace**
    
    - **What it is:** Moving to a different product or platform (often SaaS) instead of keeping the current application.
        
    - **Use case:** When off-the-shelf solutions can replace custom-built apps effectively.
        
6. **Retire**
    
    - **What it is:** Decommissioning an application that is no longer needed.
        
    - **Use case:** When the app is redundant, obsolete, or provides little business value.
        
7. **Retain** ("Revisit")
    
    - **What it is:** Keeping the application in its current environment, either because it's not ready for cloud or still providing sufficient value as-is.
        
    - **Use case:** Strategic hold due to compliance, technical constraints, or low priority.
